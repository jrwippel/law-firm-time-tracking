# Law Firm Time Tracking System

## Overview

This project is a **web-based time tracking and management system** developed for a law firm to register lawyers’ working hours, monitor activities, and support **accurate billing and strategic financial decisions**.

The system is currently **used in production by a real client**, supporting daily operations and monthly billing processes.

## Business Problem

Law firms face challenges such as:

- Lack of visibility on how lawyers' time is spent
- Difficulty in closing monthly billing accurately
- Limited data to evaluate fixed-fee (retainer) vs hourly clients
- Poor insights to support financial and strategic decisions

Manual or spreadsheet-based tracking often leads to errors, revenue loss, and lack of transparency.

## Solution

This system provides a centralized platform where:

- Lawyers register their working time per activity and client
- Managers can analyze time distribution and productivity
- Monthly billing reports are generated with accuracy
- The firm can evaluate if:
  - Fixed-fee clients exceed agreed hours
  - Hourly clients could be migrated to monthly retainers
